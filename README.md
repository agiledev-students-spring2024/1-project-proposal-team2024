# Project title
Wardrobe Wizard: Online Personal Closet Archive

# What and why?
Wardrobe Wizard is a mobile web application designed for efficient clothes archiving, outfit planning, and community engagement around fashion. The primary goal of this application is to help users organize their wardrobe, easily access their clothing inventory, and creatively put together outfits.

This application addresses the common problem of managing a large or disorganized wardrobe. Many people struggle with keeping track of what they own, leading to underutilization of garments and repetitive purchases. Wardrobe Wizard will not only help users organize their clothes but also inspire them to explore new outfit combinations, ultimately promoting sustainable fashion practices by maximizing the use of existing clothes.

# For whom?
The application targets individuals who take an active interest in fashion, have a sizable wardrobe, and are looking to optimize their clothing management. This includes fashion enthusiasts, people with busy lifestyles who need to plan outfits quickly, and anyone interested in reducing clothing waste by better utilizing what they already own.

# How?
From the end-user's perspective, Wardrobe Wizard will function as follows:

1. Clothing Inventory: Users can catalog their clothes, adding details such as color, type, brand, and size. They can also upload photos for visual reference.

2. Location Tags: Users can add comments on each item, like where it is stored or special care instructions, making it easier to find and maintain their clothes.

3. Outfit Planning: The app suggests outfits based on the user's inventory and preferences. Users can also manually create and save outfit combinations.

4. Sharing Platform: Users can share their favorite outfits on a community platform, exchange styling tips, and draw inspiration from others' fashion choices.

5. Reminder and Calendar Integration: The app can remind users when they last wore an outfit and integrate with their calendar for planning outfits for specific events.

# Scope
Developing Wardrobe Wizard can be a realistic goal for a team of 4-6 programmers over a semester. The primary challenges lie in creating an intuitive user interface for cataloging clothes and generating outfit suggestions. Additional features like the community platform and integration with external calendars can be developed incrementally.
